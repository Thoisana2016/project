			<h2>What is Java?</h2>
			<p>Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.</p>
			<p>Java is a programming language and a platform.Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.</p>
			<h6>Platform:<h6><p> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>
			<h5>Java program</h5>
			<p>Let's have a quick look at Java programming example. A detailed description of hello Java example is available in next page.</p>
			<div class="c-program">
				<h6>class Simple<br>
				{		<br>		
				public static void main(String args[])<br>
				{  		<br>
				System.out.println("Hello Java"); <br>
				}  		<br>
				}</h6>

			<h2>Java Application</h2>
			<p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:</p>
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
				<li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
				<li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
				<li>Mobile</li>
				<li>Robotics</li>
				<li>Games, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Types of Java Applications</h2>
			<p>There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:<p>
			<h5>Standalone Application</h5>
			<p>Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</p>
			<h5>Web Application</h5>
			<p>An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</p>
			<h5>Enterprise Application</h5>
			<p>An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.</p>
			<h5>Mobile Application</h5>
			<p>An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.</p>
			<h2>History of Java</h2>
			<img src="images\james.jpg" name="ritchie" title="Dennis Ritchie" height="150px" width="120px" align="right"/>
			<p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of java starts with Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>
			<p>The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted and Dynamic".</p>
			<p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. There are given the significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.</li>
				<li>Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</li>
				<li>Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and file extension was .gt.</li>
				<li>After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.</li>
				<li>Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.</li>
				<li> In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.</li>
				<li>Why had they chosen java name for java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Features of Java</h2>
			<p>The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as java buzzwords.</p>
			<p>A list of most important features of Java language is given below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Simple</li>
				<li>Object Oriented</li>
				<li>Portable</li>
				<li>Platform-independent</li>
				<li>Secured</li>
				<li>Robust</li>
				<li>Architectural neutral</li>
				<li>Interpreted</li>
				<li>High Performance</li>
				<li>Multithreaded</li>
				<li>Distributed</li>
				<li>Dynamic</li>
